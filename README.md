FOLLOW THE NUMBERS!
Alright guys, first thing you need to do is go here 1
Those are prebuilt versions of Eclipse designed specifically for what we're doing. You can try to get efxclipse
on you own install of Eclipse but I honestly don't think it's worth the hastle. Next, you're probably going to 
want to install a JRE 2
into the eclipse directory in a new subdirectory called "jre". If you're on windows and get a weird error
read the foot note 3. Next you're going to want to download the Javafx Scene builder 4. After that you should
be able to run eclipse to configure it. Read the Eclipse configurations part at 5.
Get github for desktop 6, login, and clone the project into your workspace. Let me know if you
have any trouble with using git. You should be able to open MainApp.java and press play to run the app.
To contribute GUI work, you can open dashoverview.fxml and loginscreen.fxml by right clicking on them and
selecting "open in scene builder". For making the buttons do stuff, that's done in the controllers. We're
going to model the users with models soon.

3. You might have to delete the java path from your Path. Right click on My Computer 
   and hit properties and click on advanced settings. There should be a button called
   environment variables or something on the bottom. The path is in there.
